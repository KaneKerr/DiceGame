#Dice Game
Welcome to the Dice Game project! This simple game allows players to bet on the outcome of a dice roll and win based on their chosen number and the roll's result.

How it Works:
Player Input: Players choose a number they believe the dice will roll higher than.

Outcome:
If the dice roll is higher than the player's chosen number, they win!
Otherwise, they lose the bet.
Multiplier: The multiplier for winning is determined based on the probability of winning.
Higher chosen numbers offer lower chances but higher rewards.
Lower chosen numbers offer higher chances but lower rewards.
